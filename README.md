# Problem statement:
Problems of rural education
Rural education face a lot of problem due to remote location, lack of proper resources and the lack of focus of the mainstream educational institution 

Few of the main problem in rural education and  how our system aim to solve those 
1.  Lack of management and organization
     Rural education suffers not only from inadequate allocation of resource, but often enough also from terrible management and           
     organization. physical environment in which the student is taught, the second is the curriculum or the content, which he/she 
     is taught, and the third is the teaching method or the teacher, who is teaching. by creating a Learning management system  
     we remove the need of management and organization 
2.   Lack of quality teacher training
     Often the schools available to students in rural area are Govt School which do not have proper teaching staff 
     The Learning management system s give students access to high quality teaching staff and cutting edge curriculum
3.   Late or blatantly absent
     students in rural area are very often absent or late for their classes due to various reasons like helping  parents in the
     farm or other chores and responsibilities the Learning management system provides  the student with the opportunity to learn
     conveniently according to their own schedule
