# Few of the main problem in rural education and  how our system aim to solve those 
1.  Lack of management and organization  
  Rural education suffers not only from inadequate allocation of resource, but often enough also from terrible management and organization. physical environment in which the student is taught, the second is the curriculum or the content, which he/she is taught, and the third is the teaching method or the teacher, who is teaching. by creating a Learning management system  we remove the need of management and organization 
2.   Lack of quality teacher training  
Often the schools available to students in rural area are Govt School which do not have proper teaching staff The Learning management system s give students access to high quality teaching staff and cutting edge curriculum
3.   Late or blatantly absent  
  students in rural area are very often absent or late for their classes due to various reasons like helping  parents in the farm or other chores and responsibilities the Learning management system provides  the student with the opportunity to learn conveniently according to their own schedule 
4.   Lack of resources  
  remote villages have difficulty in accessing the resources like books, stationaries and funds. our system solves it by cutting the need of all these.
5.  Outdated Sylabus  
  not just remote but even urbal places have outdated sylkabus in their curicullam, as our system is online its very easy to update the content.
